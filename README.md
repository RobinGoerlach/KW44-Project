## BattleFist: 
Rock, paper, and scissors a "battle" of quick decisions. 

### Game Rules of BattleFist:
- Objective: Players compete to win rounds by choosing the strongest move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) based on what their opponent chooses. First to reach a predetermined score (e.g., best of 5 or first to 3) wins the BattleFist showdown.
- Moves:
  * Rock: Symbolizes strength and resilience. Rock crushes Scissors.
  * Paper: Symbolizes flexibility and adaptability. Paper covers Rock.
  * Scissors: Symbolizes precision and sharpness. Scissors cut Paper.
- How to Play:
  * Each round, players choose one of the three moves (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) without revealing their choice.
  * The two players then reveal their moves simultaneously.
- Determining the Round Winner:
  * Rock beats Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors)
  * Paper beats Rock (Paper covers Rock)
  * Scissors beats Paper (Scissors cut Paper)
  * If both players choose the same move, it’s a draw, and no points are awarded.
- Scoring:
  * The winner of each round earns 1 point.
  * If players reach the predetermined score or round limit, the player with the highest score is declared the ultimate BattleFist Champion.
- Optional Battle Enhancements:
  * Power-Ups (optional): Add random power-ups that occasionally allow a player to double their score on a round, change their move mid-round, or “shield” against a loss.
  * Special Moves: Introduce a “super move” where players, if they tie three times consecutively, can choose a double-powered version of one move for an advantage.

This keeps BattleFist simple and recognizable but opens the door for fun additions if you want to expand it!
