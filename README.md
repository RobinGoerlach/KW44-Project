# KW44-Project 

## JavaScript Fun Projects Collection
Welcome to the JavaScript Fun Projects Collection! This repository includes three engaging JavaScript-based projects created to explore different programming concepts while having fun.

### Projects Overview
* BattleFirst
* Encryptorium
* PiggyLingo

#### BattleFirst
__Description__: BattleFist is a terminal-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game built with JavaScript and Node.js. This project demonstrates the basics of handling user input, random number generation, and conditional logic.

__Features:__
* Simple text-based interface in the terminal.
* Allows users to play against the computer.
* Implements basic game logic to determine the winner.
__Usage:__ Run the game with Node.js, choose rock, paper, or scissors, and see if you can beat the computer!

#### Encryptorium
__Description:__ Encryptorium is a simple Caesar Cipher encryptor built with JavaScript and Node.js. Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique where each letter in the text is shifted by a fixed number of positions. This project is great for understanding string manipulation, modular arithmetic, and basic cryptography concepts.

__Features:__
Encrypts any text using a Caesar Cipher with a user-defined shift.
Preserves uppercase and lowercase letters while keeping non-alphabetic characters intact.
Easily adjustable for encryption or decryption by changing the shift value.
Usage: Run the program in the terminal, enter the text to encrypt, and specify the shift value. The encrypted text will be displayed instantly.

#### PiggyLingo
__Description:__ PiggyLingo is an English-to-Pig Latin translator that converts regular English sentences into Pig Latin. Pig Latin is a language game often used to make words sound funny or harder to understand. This project covers the basics of text parsing and conditional logic in JavaScript.

__Features:__
* Converts individual words to Pig Latin following standard rules.
* Accepts full sentences, translating each word independently.
* Preserves word casing and handles edge cases like punctuation.
__Usage:__ Run the translator in the terminal, type an English sentence, and get the Pig Latin translation instantly.

## Getting Started
__Prerequisites__
To run any of these projects, you need to have:
* Node.js installed on your computer.

### Running a Project
1. __Clone the repository:__
git clone git@github.com:RobinGoerlach/KW44-Project.git

2. __Navigate into the project directory:__
cd KW44-Project

3. __Run the desired project using Node.js:__
node projectFileName.js

Replace *projectFileName.js* with the appropriate file name (e.g., *battleFist.js*, *encryptorium.js*, *piggyLingo.js*).

#### Future Enhancements
Each project has potential for additional features or enhancements:

* __BattleFist:__ Add score tracking, more rounds, or multiplayer mode.
* __Encryptorium:__ Add decryption capabilities or support for multiple cipher techniques.
* __PiggyLingo:__ Add support for more complex sentence structures and punctuation.
